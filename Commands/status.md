# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

Using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to pushed/pulled, etc. It is exactly what it sounds like, a status check. 



```
git add . 
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status

git push 
git status
```
