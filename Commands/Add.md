# git add

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command.

Items that have not been "Tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.

Generally, you can get away with the command `git add .` which will add All files and directories that were added, changed, or deleted.

You can track changes to specific files using `git add flie1 file2 `which wil track specifically file1 and file2.

You can specify tracking directories with `git and DirectoryName`.
