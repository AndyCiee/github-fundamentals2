# git clone

CLoning a repository  is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull updated from the orginal repository.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
